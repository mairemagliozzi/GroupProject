We are studying African Penguins

The first article is called, “Success Comes with Consistency in Hard times: Forging Repeatability relates to Sex and Breeding Output in African Penguins” written by Gwendoline Traisnel and Lorien Pichegru. To summarize, the research focuses on consistency when it comes to environmental changes. The research is suggesting that “penguins may increase their consistency in foraging to face poor resource conditions and potentially increase their breeding success”. One critique is that there may have been a confound during an experiment where the experimenter was testing the behavior of young African Penguins while there was only one parent of the penguins present instead of two. Realistically both parents present may be more usual instead of one which could produce unrealistic behavior. The hypothesis is that if breeding consistency and success are increased in African Penguins due to environmental changes, then their offspring will physically change and adapt.

The second article is called, “Evaluating the Behavior and Temperament of African Penguins in a Non-Contact Animal Encounter Program” written by Sana Saiyad, Lydia Hopper, and Katherine Cronin. To summarize, this research is focused on 15 African Penguins in a program at the Lincoln Park Zoo through 16 weeks of collected behavioral data. The study investigates the behavioral impacts of the program and the penguin's individual characteristics, temperament, and voluntary participation. This research concludes that this program has a neutral or positive impact on the African Penguins. One critique that I have is that this research made clear the different types of environmental influences that are needed to look out for, like visitors, male-female African penguin ratio, and the program in general. There was no experimental bias due to the use of naturalistic observation. The hypothesis is that if African Penguins are in this encounter program and experience negative and positive effects then they will not improve outside of this encounter program. 

Article 3: Sutton G, Pichegru L, Botha JA, Kouzani AZ, Adams S, Bost CA, Arnould JPY. 2020. Multi-predator assemblages, dive type, bathymetry and sex influence foraging success and efficiency in African penguins. PeerJ 8:e9380. https://peerj.com/articles/9380/ 

The third article is called, “Multi-predator assemblages, dive type, bathymetry and sex influence foraging success and efficiency in African penguins” edited by Patricia Gandini. To summarize, this research focuses on the foraging strategies in African penguins, the changes to prey availability, and responses to climate change which is affected by the other variables. In Algoa Bay, South Africa, the African Penguins there were observed to show “sex-specific diving behaviors” and efficiency within groups and individuals. One critique is that the article used randomization when creating data to create more accuracy. This was done so they could make the data more credible by showing repetition throughout. The hypothesis is that if the presence of larger predators decreases the prey capture rates of African penguins then they will become less endangered. 

Article 4: Sharp, Stuart. (2021) “Passive acoustic monitoring of the endangered African Penguin (Spheniscus demersus) using autonomous recording units and ecoacoustic indices” IbisVolume 163, Issue 4.   https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ibi.12970 

The fourth article is called, “Passive acoustic monitoring of the endangered African Penguin (Spheniscus demersus) using autonomous recording units and ecoacoustic indices” edited by Stuart Sharp. To summarize, this article focuses on the need for the “use of vocal signals for intra-specific vocal communication”. This study collects recordings from African Penguins during breeding season to document the relation between circadian rhythms of vocal activity and how it informs experimenters on the specific breeding activity of the colony. One critique is that the article uses randomination while dealing with the data. The article clearly states that “audio files were randomly chosen to be inspected by a second blind observer”. The hypothesis is that if using African penguins vocalizations assist in monitoring the species then it will also minimize endangerment and disturbance. 

Article 5: Parsons, N.J., Gous, T.A., Schaefer, A.M. & Vanstreels, R.E.T., 2016, “Health evaluation of African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) in southern Africa”, Onderstepoort Journal of Veterinary Research 83(1), a1147. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6238701/ 

The fifth article is called, “Health evaluation of African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) in southern Africa” written by Nola Parsons, Tertius Gous, Adam Schaefer and Ralph Vanstreels. To summarize, this research focuses on the fact that disease surveillance was declared the primary reason that African penguins are an endangered seabird. This test is about identifying what specific potential pathogens are spreading around in the species. The findings conclude that African penguins may have been exposed to conservation-significant pathogens. One critique is that internal validity was taken into account. The article mentions how other studies used internal validity by avoiding methodological errors. The hypothesis is that if there were conservation-significant pathogens spreading within African penguins then that helps studies further discover how to isolate and detect the pathogens to stop endangerment. 

Research Design:

This study is based on the two African penguin colonies in Algoa Bay, South Africa. If the predator of African penguins is decreasing then we would be using both direct observation and indirect observation to test the increase of African penguins. It is best to use a combination of both of these methods to track the future increase of African penguins and compare it to past patterns of increase.  Researchers will observe the inverse relationship between the decrease in the predator population and the increase in the African penguin population. Observers will also take in the old patterns between the two populations to see if the increase of African penguins is at a higher rate than the decrease in the predator population. The experimenters will be using naturalistic observation to record the current rates of the African penguin population. Using naturalistic observation will stop experimenter bias due to no interventions or changing any factors with an independent variable. The researchers will use both systematic and random time sampling procedures to get a representative sample of the two populations' natural environments. This test will be only represented to these specific two colonies in Algoa Bay due to the endangerment of African penguins. When it comes to recording behavior, researchers will use selected records of behaviors by obtaining quantitative measures of behavior and the specific increase or decrease in both populations. Overall naturalistic observation is the best option for obtaining a quantitative analysis of the rates of increase in the African penguin population. 

Research Design: Ethics:

One issue we could run into is that we would be tracking multiple species as we are tracking the population of the predators of African penguins. African penguins are monogamous, which means they stay with the same partner for life, and breed in colonies on rocky shores. Females can lay two eggs per clutch. Female Penguins can suffer discomfort if they are removed from male mates, which can affect their performance bias on how they perform. With the added stress of having researchers around, the production performance can decrease, becoming a selection bias. Since we are just observing we would not need to purposely cause any sort of physical harm to the penguins. If we were to separate the males and females to create more focus in research, it could cause emotional discomfort to the penguins. We would also need to make sure we are considering the culture in South Africa and respecting their land as well. We would try to keep our presence known to a minimum and make sure we have the proper approval from whomever it is needed from. We would be sure to avoid plagiarism by crediting the previous research we are using. We hope to be as ethical as possible in our research.
